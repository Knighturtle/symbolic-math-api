# Mini Mathway (Portfolio Version)

A minimal **FastAPI + SymPy** project that demonstrates symbolic math operations through an API.  
This project is designed as a **portfolio piece** to showcase skills in API design, testing, and CI/CD integration.

## 🛠️ Future Enhancements
Planned extensions to approach the functionality of Mathway:
- `/evaluate`: numeric evaluation with variable substitution  
- `/solve`: equation solving (linear, quadratic, systems)  
- `/factor` & `/expand`: factorization and expansion  
- `/derivative` & `/integral`: calculus (derivatives & integrals)  
- Step-by-step solution explanations for educational use  

---

## 📚 Key Takeaways
- Built and tested an API combining **FastAPI** and **SymPy**  
- Learned asynchronous testing with **pytest-asyncio**  
- Set up **CI/CD pipelines** with GitHub Actions  
- Maintained a clean and professional repository (template repo, `.gitignore`, test coverage)
