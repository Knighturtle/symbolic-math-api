## 🚀 Roadmap
- [ ] /solve: equation solving (linear, quadratic, systems)
- [ ] /integral: calculus (integrals)
- [ ] /derivative: calculus (derivatives)
- [ ] /factor & /expand: expression manipulation
- [ ] Step-by-step solution explanations

## 📚 Key Takeaways
- Built and tested an API combining **FastAPI** and **SymPy**  
- Learned asynchronous testing with **pytest-asyncio**  
- Set up **CI/CD pipelines** with GitHub Actions  
- Maintained a clean and professional repository (template repo, `.gitignore`, test coverage)
